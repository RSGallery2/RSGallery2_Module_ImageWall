Question is about merging two images, however in this specified case you shouldn't do that. You should put Content Image (ie. cover) into <img /> tag, and Style Image into CSS, why?

    As I said the cover belongs to the content of the document, while that vinyl record and shadow are just a part of the page styles.
    Such separation is much more convenient to use. User can easily copy that image. It's easier to index by web-spiders.
    Finally, it's much easier to maintain.

So use a very simple code:

<div class="cover">
   <img src="/content/images/covers/movin-mountains.png" alt="Moving mountains by Pneuma" width="100" height="100" />
</div>

.cover {
    padding: 10px;
    padding-right: 100px;

    background: url(/style/images/cover-background.png) no-repeat;
}
